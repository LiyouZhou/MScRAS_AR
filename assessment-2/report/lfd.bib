  abstract = {We investigate the use of prior knowledge of human and animal movement to learn reusable locomotion skills for real legged robots. Our approach builds upon previous work on imitating human or dog Motion Capture (MoCap) data to learn a movement skill module. Once learned, this skill module can be reused for complex downstream tasks. Importantly, due to the prior imposed by the MoCap data, our approach does not require extensive reward engineering to produce sensible and natural looking behavior at the time of reuse. This makes it easy to create well-regularized, task-oriented controllers that are suitable for deployment on real robots. We demonstrate how our skill module can be used for imitation, and train controllable walking and ball dribbling policies for both the ANYmal quadruped and OP3 humanoid. These policies are then deployed on hardware via zero-shot simulation-to-reality transfer. Accompanying videos are available at https://bit.ly/robot-npmp.},

  abstract = {With the fast improvement of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to automate human tasks in different areas. However, training such agents is difficult and restricted to expert users. Moreover, it is mostly limited to simulation environments due to the high cost and safety concerns of interactions in the real world. Demonstration Learning is a paradigm in which an agent learns to perform a task by imitating the behavior of an expert shown in demonstrations. It is a relatively recent area in machine learning, but it is gaining significant traction due to having tremendous potential for learning complex behaviors from demonstrations. Learning from demonstration accelerates the learning process by improving sample efficiency, while also reducing the effort of the programmer. Due to learning without interacting with the environment, demonstration learning would allow the automation of a wide range of real world applications such as robotics and healthcare. This paper provides a survey of demonstration learning, where we formally introduce the demonstration problem along with its main challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of the process of learning from demonstrations from the creation of the demonstration data set, to learning methods from demonstrations, and optimization by combining demonstration learning with different machine learning methods. We also review the existing benchmarks and identify their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the paradigm as well as its main applications. Lastly, we discuss our perspective on open problems and research directions for this rapidly growing field.},

Curriculum learning solves complicated RL tasks by introducing a sequence of auxiliary tasks with increasing difficulty, yet how to automatically design effective and generalizable curricula remains a challenging research problem. ACED extracts curricula from a small amount of expert demonstration trajectories by dividing demonstrations into sections and initializing training episodes to states sampled from different sections of demonstrations. Through moving the reset states from the end to the beginning of demonstrations as the learning agent improves its performance, ACED not only learns challenging manipulation tasks with unseen initializations and goals, but also discovers novel solutions that are distinct from the demonstrations. In addition, ACED can be naturally combined with other imitation learning methods to utilize expert demonstrations in a more efficient manner, and we show that a combination of ACED with behavior cloning allows pick-and-place tasks to be learned with as few as 1 demonstration and block stacking tasks to be learned with 20 demonstrations.},

The entire motor repertoire can be spanned by applying a well-defined set of operations and transformations to these primitives and by combining them in many different ways according to well-defined syntactic rules. Motor and movement primitives and modules might exist at the neural, dynamic and kinematic levels with complicated mapping among the elementary building blocks subserving these different levels of representation. Hence, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in unravelling the nature of these primitives, new experimental, computational and conceptual approaches are needed to further advance our understanding of motor compositionality.}

Since the human coworker can execute a variety of unforeseen tasks a requirement of our system is that the robot assistant must be able to adapt and learn new skills on-demand, without the need of an expert programmer. Thus, this paper leverages on the framework of imitation learning and its application to human-robot interaction using the concept of Interaction Primitives (IPs). We introduce the use of Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs) to devise an interaction method that both recognizes the action of a human and generates the appropriate movement primitive of the robot assistant. We evaluate our method on experiments using a lightweight arm interacting with a human partner and also using motion capture trajectories of two humans assembling a box. The advantages of ProMPs in relation to the original formulation for interaction are exposed and compared.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses novel techniques to leverage offline expert data using offline and online training to obtain faster convergence and improved performance. The proposed algorithm (AWET) weights the critic losses with a novel agent advantage weight to improve over the expert data. In addition, AWET makes use of an automatic early termination technique to stop and discard policy rollouts that are not similar to expert trajectories---to prevent drifting far from the expert data. In an ablation study, AWET showed improved and promising performance when compared to state-of-the-art baselines on four standard robotic tasks.},

In this work, we introduce a bootstrapping technique that establishes such parameterized skills incrementally. The approach combines iterative learning with state-of-the-art black-box policy optimization. We investigate the benefits of incrementally learning parameterized skills for efficient policy retrieval and show that the number of required rollouts can be significantly reduced when optimizing policies for novel tasks.

Our agent is trained using off-the-shelf reinforcement learning, but starts every episode by resetting to a state from a demonstration. By starting from such demonstration states, the agent requires much less exploration to learn a game compared to when it starts from the beginning of the game at every episode. We analyze reinforcement learning for tasks with sparse rewards in a simple toy environment, where we show that the run-time of standard RL methods scales exponentially in the number of states between rewards. Our method reduces this to quadratic scaling, opening up many tasks that were previously infeasible. We then apply our method to Montezuma's Revenge, for which we present a trained agent achieving a high-score of 74,500, better than any previously published result.},

  abstract = {Biological systems, including human beings, have the innate ability to perform complex tasks in versatile and agile manner. Researchers in sensorimotor control have tried to understand and formally define this innate property. The idea, supported by several experimental findings, that biological systems are able to combine and adapt basic units of motion into complex tasks finally lead to the formulation of the motor primitives theory. In this respect, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) represent an elegant mathematical formulation of the motor primitives as stable dynamical systems, and are well suited to generate motor commands for artificial systems like robots. In the last decades, DMPs have inspired researchers in different robotic fields including imitation and reinforcement learning, optimal control,physical interaction, and human-robot co-working, resulting a considerable amount of published papers. The goal of this tutorial survey is two-fold. On one side, we present the existing DMPs formulations in rigorous mathematical terms,and discuss advantages and limitations of each approach as well as practical implementation details. In the tutorial vein, we also search for existing implementations of presented approaches and release several others. On the other side, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of existing literature and categorize state of the art work on DMP. The paper concludes with a discussion on the limitations of DMPs and an outline of possible research directions.},

  abstract = {Locally weighted learning (LWL) is a class of techniques from nonparametric statistics that provides useful representations and training algorithms for learning about complex phenomena during autonomous adaptive control of robotic systems. This paper introduces several LWL algorithms that have been tested successfully in real-time learning of complex robot tasks. We discuss two major classes of LWL, memory-based LWL and purely incremental LWL that does not need to remember any data explicitly. In contrast to the traditional belief that LWL methods cannot work well in high-dimensional spaces, we provide new algorithms that have been tested on up to 90 dimensional learning problems. The applicability of our LWL algorithms is demonstrated in various robot learning examples, including the learning of devil-sticking, pole-balancing by a humanoid robot arm, and inverse-dynamics learning for a seven and a 30 degree-of-freedom robot. In all these examples, the application of our statistical neural networks techniques allowed either faster or more accurate acquisition of motor control than classical control engineering.},

  abstract = {Reward specification is a notoriously difficult problem in reinforcement learning, requiring extensive expert supervision to design robust reward functions. Imitation learning (IL) methods attempt to circumvent these problems by utilizing expert demonstrations but typically require a large number of in-domain expert demonstrations. Inspired by advances in the field of Video-and-Language Models (VLMs), we present RoboCLIP, an online imitation learning method that uses a single demonstration (overcoming the large data requirement) in the form of a video demonstration or a textual description of the task to generate rewards without manual reward function design. Additionally, RoboCLIP can also utilize out-of-domain demonstrations, like videos of humans solving the task for reward generation, circumventing the need to have the same demonstration and deployment domains. RoboCLIP utilizes pretrained VLMs without any finetuning for reward generation. Reinforcement learning agents trained with RoboCLIP rewards demonstrate 2-3 times higher zero-shot performance than competing imitation learning methods on downstream robot manipulation tasks, doing so using only one video/text demonstration.
